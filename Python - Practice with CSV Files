Take a look at the CSV file. It contains the semicolon-separated results of a study in which male and female subjects with the common cold measured how long they experienced their symptoms (in days).

Your task is to load and process the data to print the following five lines (one empty):

Male subjects: {count_of_male_subjects}
Average duration: {average_male_duration}

Female subject: {count_of_female_subjects}
Average duration: {average_female_duration}



import csv

with open('study.csv') as file:
  csv_reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=';')
  male_count = 0
  male_total = 0
  female_count = 0
  female_total = 0
  for row in csv_reader:
    if row[1] == 'M':
      male_total += float(row[2])
      male_count += 1
    elif row[1] == 'F':
      female_total += float(row[2])
      female_count += 1
  print('Male subjects:', male_count)
  print('Average duration:', male_total/male_count)
  print('')
  print('Female subjects:', female_count)
  print('Average duration:', female_total/female_count)

The company would like to know which project are the most important. For project for which employees devoted more than 40 hours, add ' (VIP)' at the end of its name. The name should look like this: PROJECT NAME (VIP). Mind the space between project name and (VIP).

WITH vip AS(SELECT
	project_id, sum(hours_spent)
FROM allocation
GROUP BY project_id
HAVING sum(hours_spent) > 40)

UPDATE project
SET name = name||' (VIP)'
WHERE id IN (SELECT project_id FROM vip)

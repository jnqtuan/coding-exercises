We've created another table called project_worktime. It has the following columns: project_id and avg_worktime. Your task is to use the table allocation and insert the average number of hours spent on each project into the new table project_worktime. Each time, insert the project_id and the average hours_spent. Additionally, do not insert any data for project_id = 1.

WITH

sum AS(
SELECT DISTINCT
  project_id,
  employee_id,
  SUM(hours_spent) OVER(PARTITION BY project_id, employee_id)
FROM allocation
WHERE project_id != 1),

average AS(
SELECT
  project_id,
  avg(sum)
FROM sum
GROUP BY project_id)


INSERT INTO project_worktime
SELECT * FROM average
